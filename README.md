# K-Means Clustering on Crime Data

This project performs K-Means clustering on crime data from Baltimore. It reads crime data from a CSV file, extracts coordinates, and applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group the data into clusters based on their spatial proximity. The results are saved in an output file and visualized using a geoplot.

## Features

- Reads and preprocesses data from a CSV file.
- Extracts coordinates for clustering.
- Calculates distances using the Minkowski distance formula (default: Euclidean distance).
- Initializes random centroids for clustering.
- Iteratively updates centroids based on the mean of points in each cluster.
- Assigns points to clusters based on the nearest centroid.
- Saves clustering results, including initial and final centroids, iterations, and labeled datasets, to an output file.
- Visualizes the clustering results using the `geoplot` library.

## File Structure

```
.gitignore
clustering crimes.py   # Main script for K-Means clustering
crime-data.csv         # Input dataset containing crime data
geoplot.py             # Visualization library for plotting clusters
output.txt             # Output file containing clustering results
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `matplotlib` (for geoplot visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Ensure the `crime-data.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python "clustering crimes.py"
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Perform K-Means clustering with default values (`k=7`, `p=2`).
   - Save the results to `output.txt`.
   - Visualize the clusters using the `geoplot` library.

## Output

- **`output.txt`**: Contains the following:
  - Initial centroids
  - Final centroids
  - Number of iterations
  - Labeled dataset with cluster assignments
- **Geoplot Visualization**: Displays the clusters on a map.

## Customization

- Modify the number of clusters (`k`) and the distance metric parameter (`p`) in the script:
  ```python
  k = 7  # Number of clusters
  p = 2  # Minkowski distance parameter (2 for Euclidean distance)
  ```

## Example

Sample output in `output.txt`:
```
K-Means Clustering Output from crime-data.csv
K = 7

Initial Centroids:
(-76.61961, 39.29164)
...

Final Centroids:
(-76.60463, 39.32736)
...

Iterations: 5

Labeled Dataset:
0 : Crime Type A                        [39.29164, -76.61961]
...
```
